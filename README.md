## My 2 cents
- I noticed that the original version (FitBit_Xamarin_Forms) having only iOS and Android "targets". 
UWP "target" added/"injected" by me into FitBitWebAuthenticator solution ("fork"). 
- Min. os. win. switched to 16299. Note that no WinMobile compatibility realized at/by now! .NET Standard 2.0 used.
